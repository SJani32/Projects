Computer Vision Projects
1. Face Detection (using Transfer Learnning - Masked Image)
   - This project aims to detect the faces present in the image using the masked data and using Transfer Learning of a pre-trained model (trained on ImageNet data) and returns the original image with a mask showing the detected face.
  
2. Face Detection (using Pre-Triained weights - Detect Face with bounding box)
   - The Cascade Classifier model is used to detect the face in the image and returns the origianl image wth a bounding box around the detected object.
  
3. Facial Recognition
   - Generate an embedding vector for each image and using those embedding create a simple classification model that recognies the person in the image.
