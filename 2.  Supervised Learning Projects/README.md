  3. Customer Churn Prediction
     - This project is intended to identify the customer (Telecom company) who shall churn based on 19 features.
     - This project is bifurcated in 2 parts:
        1. Build XGBoost model to classify the customers and later on enhance the performance of the model.
        2. Use various models to perfom classification task and identify the best performing model amongst them. The models build in this section are:
         > Logistic Regression
         > Gaussina Naive Bayes Classifier
         > K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
         > Support Vector Classifier
         > Decision Tree Classifier
         > Bagging Classifier
         > AdaBoost Classifier
         > Gradient Boost Classifier
         > Random Forest Classifier
         > XGBoost Classifier
         > LightGBM Classifier
