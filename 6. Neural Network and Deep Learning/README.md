Neural Network & Deep Learning Projects:
1. Predictive Modeling
   - This project aims to idenify the signal strength using 11 parameters and building Neural Network model from scratch.
  
2. Image Recognition - Number Identification
   - This projects is intended to convert the balck & white image data into a tabular format and classify the number present in the image by buildong the Neural Network models from scratch.
