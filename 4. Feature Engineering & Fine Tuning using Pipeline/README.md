FE & FT using Pipeline - Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing Process
  - This projects aims at classifying an anomaly in manufacturing process of a product with initially 591 features.
  - Using various Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques, a proper process is to be generated (Pipeline method) to refine the data set.
  - Models Build:
    * Logistic Regression (various Validation Techniques like KFold, StratifiedKFold, LeaveOneOut are used with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to enhance model's perfromance).
    * Following models are used alongwith Hyperparameter Tuning and the best model is pickeled for further use
      > Logistic Regression
      > K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
      > Support Vector Classifier
      > Decision Tree Classifier
      > Bagging Classifier
      > AdaBoost Classifier
      > Gradient Boost Classifier
      > Random Forest Classifier
      > CatBoost Classifier
      > XGBoost Classifier
      > LightGBM Classifier
